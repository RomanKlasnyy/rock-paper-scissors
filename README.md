This is my first project with creating and reading an external file for data. Enter your name, get your score from rating.txt (ex. Roman 100), or start with 0 with a new name. Then choose how to play. Classic game - press Enter. Unusual game - enter elements clockwise, where element loses to the next element (win is counterclockwise). Use pictures as a reference.
